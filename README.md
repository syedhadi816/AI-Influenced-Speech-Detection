The proliferation of generative AI tools has raised concerns about the authenticity of responses in spoken language assessments. This study presents an interpretable, AI-driven framework to detect plagiarized or AI-influenced speech by analyzing speech delivery in addition to content. Using a dataset of 640 audio samples from a high-stakes English language proficiency test, we extract a comprehensive set of linguistic and acoustic features—such as speech rate, pause patterns, lexical richness, prosody, and energy entropy—to characterize spontaneous versus nonspontaneous responses. Ten machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), were trained and evaluated. The SVM and MLP models achieved the highest accuracy of 89%, outperforming traditional content-based AI plagiarism detection approaches. Additionally, we conducted statistical tests to validate feature discriminability, revealing significant differences in both mean and variance across most features between spontaneous and AI-influenced speech. Our results demonstrate the potential of feature-based, interpretable machine learning to bolster test security and provide fairer assessments in spoken language testing environments.
